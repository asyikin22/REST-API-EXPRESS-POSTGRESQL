# SETTING UP DATABASE

**Confirm connection to PostgreSQL:** 
* Type "\conninfo"

**To see existing database and create new one:**
* Type "\l"
* Create a new database: " CREATE DATABASE students"
* 'Student' database created 2nd from bottom of the list

**Connect to database to create a table: "\c students"**

**CREATE TABLE students**
* ID - SERIAL as it will auto-increment every time we create students starting from 1.
* Name
* Email
* Age
* Date of birth
* \dt = display table

**CREATE NEW STUDENTS**
* INSERT INTO students (name, email, age, dob)
* VALUES (####)
* Display table: # SELECT * FROM students

# pg-pool package

**WHAT IS IT?**:
* It's a connection pool for the pg package, specifically designed to manage and reuse PostgreSQL client connections efficiently.
* It is a popular Node.js library for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.
* It provides a simple and efficient way to execute SQL queries, handle transactions, and manage connections to a PostgreSQL database.

**PASSWORD ISSUES**:
* I have changed the authentication method for PostgreSQL to 'trust', it means that the database server trusts me, effectively removing the password requirement for local connections. 

**Creating a "database connection pool" in Node.js**

# VS CODE SET UP

**Create file structure within 'student' folder**
* Queries.js - this where we store all our SQL queries we're going to use against our database
* Routes.js - this is where we store our students routes
* Controller.js - this is where we store our business logic thatâ€™s related to each route

**Create a student route in routes.js**
* Define an Express.js router for handling API routes in routes.js file
* Import module inside main file and mount the student router at the '/api' path
* Test in Postman if it route is succesfully created.

**Get the students from the database - USING CONTROLLER**
* Instead of sending strings using API routes, we will now send students from DB back to the user
* When user ping this route '/', we want to query our DB, get the JSON response with our students and send it back to user
* Create a 'getStudents' function in controller file which we will use in over in our route file

# RETRIEVE DATA FROM POSTGRESQL INTO VS CODE

**Get the students from the database - IMPORT DB FROM DB.JS FILE**
* Using pool to query our DB
* Query method has 2 parameters
  1) SQL statement - statement used to query the DB
  2) Callbacks (error, results)
* Add MW in the main file to post and get JSON from our endpoints
* It's used to handle JSON data sent by clients in POST requests and makes the parsed JSON data available in req.body for further processing within route handlers.

**Now we test it in Postman, we will get the two student data we created in PostgreSQL earlier**

**Separate out queries from the business logic inside controller file**
* As the data increases in size, we need to separate it from the controller file to organize the codes better and not get things mixed up
* We will shift the queries 'get Students into queries.js file and import it back to the controller file

# GET A SPECIFIC STUDENT BY ID 

**GET A SPECIFIC STUDENT BY ID - INSIDE PSQL**
* Type SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 1
* It will return student with id number 1.

**GET A SPECIFIC STUDENT BY ID - INSERT THE LOGIC INTO QUERY FILE**
* Add new queries inside query file - getStudentsById
* Inside router file, create a new route
* Inside controller file, create that route
